# Simon-Game-Challenge
Simon is a classic electronic memory game. The game features four colored buttons that light up and emit a tone when pressed. Players must repeat the sequence of button presses in the correct order. The game starts with a simple pattern, but it gets progressively more difficult as players advance through the levels.
